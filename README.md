This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques. The code is intended to provide a demonstration and understanding of the process. Below are instructions on how to run the code and any dependencies required.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yusrahfathima/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. You can use the provided Jupyter notebook (`stock_price_prediction.ipynb`) or run the Python script directly. To use the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook stock_price_prediction.ipynb
```

4. If you prefer to run the Python script, use the following command:

```bash
python stock_price_prediction.py
```

## Configuration

- You may need to adjust the configuration in the script or notebook to specify the stock symbol, date range, and any specific machine learning algorithms or parameters you want to use.

## Data

- Ensure you have the historical stock price data that you want to analyze. This data can be obtained from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The data should include at least the Date and Close price.

Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific needs and requirements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Thank you for using this stock price prediction tool!

Certainly, one of the commonly used data sources for stock price prediction is Alpha Vantage. Here's a brief description of Alpha Vantage as a data source:

**Data Source: Alpha Vantage**

**Description:**

Alpha Vantage is a financial data platform that provides historical and real-time data for various financial instruments, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex. It offers an API that allows developers and data scientists to access a wide range of financial data, making it a popular choice for stock price prediction using machine learning.

Key features of Alpha Vantage include:

- **Historical Price Data**: Alpha Vantage provides historical daily, weekly, and monthly price data for stocks, including open, high, low, close, and volume.

- **Intraday Data**: It also offers intraday price data at different time intervals (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute), which is useful for high-frequency trading strategies.

- **Fundamental Data**: You can access fundamental data, including financial statements, income statements, balance sheets, and more.

- **Technical Indicators**: Alpha Vantage provides a wide range of technical indicators that can be used as features for machine learning models. These include moving averages, RSI, MACD, and many others.

- **API Access**: You can obtain data via the Alpha Vantage API, which requires an API key (free and paid options available). The API allows you to make requests for historical and real-time data in various formats, such as JSON or CSV.

To access historical stock price data from Alpha Vantage, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the Alpha Vantage website (https://www.alphavantage.co/).

2. Sign up for an account to obtain an API key.

3. Use the API key to make requests to Alpha Vantage's API to fetch historical stock price data for the specific stock symbol, date range, and data frequency you need.

4. You can also explore their documentation and examples to understand how to use the API effectively.

After obtaining the historical stock price data from Alpha Vantage, you can use it for feature engineering, training machine learning models, and making predictions. This data source is widely used in the financial industry for quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and stock price prediction.
